Hello Mario Assets

Ripped, converted, and imported to Unity by Hello Fangaming.

All models were ripped from various Nintendo games. Mainly Super Mario 3D World.

Designed for Unity 2019.4 and above. Old versions may or may not work.

Notes:
Some models, like pipes for example, have alternate colors. Check the Mat folder, and drag and drop them on the model to use.
Many characters and enemies have different facial expressions, hands, powerups, and other parts as seperate GameObjects you can enable and disable.
Sign board arrows are seperate GameObjects you can enable and disable.
The materials in the Materials folder can be used on your level geometry.
